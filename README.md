# PerfectDraft Card

A custom Lovelace card for the [PerfectDraft Pro Home Assistant integration](https://github.com/Falkvinge/hassio-integration-perfectdraft-pro). Displays your keg status at a glance — what beer is on tap, its temperature, and how many glasses remain — using a beer emoji pictogram.

Designed and optimised for the Sonoff NSPanel Pro 120 in landscape mode, but works on any HA dashboard.

## Features

- **Five layouts** — landscape, portrait, compact, hero, or single-vessel gauge; choose what fits your dashboard (defaults to landscape, so existing cards are unchanged)
- **Beer emoji pictogram** — see how many glasses remain in your keg at a glance, in a grid that shrinks to fit narrow cards
- **Built-in beer catalog** — 75+ PerfectDraft beers, 68 with real keg photos; brand-tinted fallback art for the rest so every beer looks intentional
- **Glass size selector** — tap the emoji zone to choose between 250 mL, 330 mL, 500 mL, UK pint, or US pint
- **Beer selector** — tap the label zone to pick your current beer from the catalog
- **Freshness warnings** — escalating CSS-animated alerts as your keg approaches its 30-day expiry
- **UI-driven configuration** — no YAML editing required; everything is set up through the visual card editor

## Requirements

- [PerfectDraft Pro integration](https://github.com/Falkvinge/hassio-integration-perfectdraft-pro) installed and configured

### On-card interactions

| Action | What happens |
|--------|-------------|
| Tap the **left zone** (beer label) | Opens beer selection dialog |
| Tap the **right zone** (emoji grid) | Opens glass size selection dialog |

Selections persist in your browser across page refreshes.

## Layouts

Set `layout` (or pick it in the visual editor) to match where the card lives:

| Layout | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| `landscape` (default) | Wall panels (NSPanel Pro), wide cards — label left, emoji grid right |
| `portrait` | Phones and tall/narrow columns — label on top, grid below |
| `compact` | Dense dashboards — a single row with a remaining-beer bar |
| `hero` | Showing off the beer — full-bleed keg photo with status overlaid |
| `vessel` | A calm single glass that fills to show how much is left |

The emoji grid is width-tolerant: it shrinks to fit narrow cards instead of overflowing. Power users can force a column count with `matrix_columns` or cap/centre the grid with `max_matrix_width`.

## Supported glass sizes

| Size | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 250 mL | Small glass |
| 330 mL | Bottle / standard |
| 500 mL | Half litre |
| 568 mL | Pint (UK) |
| 473 mL | Pint (US) |

## Sensor entities used

The card reads these sensors from the PerfectDraft integration:

| Sensor | Used for |
|--------|----------|
| `*_temperature` | Beer temperature display |
| `*_keg_remaining` | Glasses remaining calculation |
| `*_keg_freshness` | Freshness warning system |
